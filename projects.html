    <h2 id="wildfire-nonrenewal-letters">Streamline Wilfire Nonrenewals Response Letters - Progressive Insurance</h2>
    <br>
    <!-- Section: Business Problem -->
    <h3>Business Problem</h3>
    <p>
        State insurance regulators and customers often inquire for further information to support non-renewing their home insurance policy due to high wildfire risk. Accurate and timely responses are required to maintain good working relationships with state regulators. The process required multiple handoffs between different departments leading to delays in responses and served as a distraction for multiple teams. 
    </p>

    <!-- Section: My Solution -->
    <h3>My Solution</h3>
    <p>
        I built an online web app/dashboard using Python (Streamlit + Plotly Dash) that queried policy information and generated our response letters.
    </p>

    <!-- Optional description -->
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The tool was deployed as a web application, allowing the Consumer Relations department to access and respond to customer inquiries more efficiently. Hosting via GitHub ensured smooth version control and easy updates as policies, legal guidelines, and wildfire exposure data evolved over time.

    <h2 id="month-end-process">Automation of Month-End Process â€“ Progressive Insurance</h2>
    <br>
    <!-- Section: Business Problem -->
    <h3>Business Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Each month, Progressive Home conducted a modeling process to assess risk exposure to natural catastrophic events. This process relied heavily on a series of disconnected SQL queries and manual data validation steps, often consuming several daysâ€”or even weeksâ€”of an analystâ€™s time.
    </p>

    <!-- Section: My Solution -->
    <h3>My Solution</h3>
    <p>
        I consolidated the standalone SQL queries into optimized stored procedures and developed a Python pipeline to execute them sequentially. The pipeline also automated the associated data validation tasks, ensuring both efficiency and consistency.
    </p>

    <!-- Section: Description -->
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This automation reduced the time required for the monthly process by several days and served as a foundational tool for future enhancements. It also helped accelerate Python adoption within the analytics team and provided a reusable framework for automating other parts of the modeling workflow.

<h2 id="tutor-kpitracker-automation">Tutor KPI Automation â€“ Revolution Prep</h2>
<br>
<!-- Section: Business Problem -->
<h3>Business Problem</h3>
<p>
    Revolution Prep employs over 200 tutors, managed by a team of 5â€“6 tutor managers. Each month, individual KPI reports were generated for every tutor, requiring managers to manually copy data from a central master file into 200+ separate documents. This repetitive task consumed a significant number of hours each month, diverting manager time away from strategic responsibilities.
</p>

<!-- Section: My Solution -->
<h3>My Solution</h3>
<p>
    I built an automated Python solutionâ€”using Selenium and file handling librariesâ€”to transfer and format data from the master KPI file into each individual tutorâ€™s KPI file. The process required minimal manual input and ensured consistency across all reports.
</p>

<!-- Section: Description -->
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    The automation saved hours of salaried tutor manager time every month, enabling them to concentrate on maintaining tutor quality and performance. This project laid the foundation for increasing the average tutor-to-manager ratio from ~50 to ~75, allowing the company to scale operations without hiring additional managersâ€”directly improving operational efficiency and profit margins.

<h2 id="school-pay-dashboards">School Dashboards â€“ Revolution Prep</h2>
<br>
<!-- Section: Business Problem -->
<h3>Business Problem</h3>
<p>
    Revolution Prep partners with schools to deliver academic tutoring and test preparation services. A key challenge in maintaining these partnerships was the lack of accessible, transparent data to demonstrate the impact and value of the services provided. Schools often found it difficult to obtain actionable insights on student progress, making it harder to justify continued investment.
</p>

<!-- Section: My Solution -->
<h3>My Solution</h3>
<p>
    I developed web applications that allowed school-pay partners to securely log in and access both high-level overviews and detailed student-level data. These platforms made it easy for administrators to evaluate student engagement and outcomes, directly highlighting the value of their partnership with Revolution Prep.
</p>

<!-- Section: Description -->
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    These tools significantly improved transparency and strengthened relationships with partner schools. In several cases, they were instrumental in retaining school programs that required measurable results to justify ongoing investment in student support services.

    <h3>Academic Problem</h3>
    <p>
        During graduate school, my research focused on the recycling of water through the land surface (evapotranspiration, or ET) and how land-surface-regulated water flow impacts weather extremes.  Does local or remote ET constitute a major source of precipitation for communities across North America? How do precipitation anomolies or land surface changes in upwind ET source regions alter precipitation patterns downwind? 
    </p>
    <p>
      To study these questions, I used the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Earth System Model (CESM), a global climate model enhanced with water tracers to track the movement of water molecules across the continent. At the time, CESM could not track the individual components of ETâ€”evaporation from soil and freshwater sources, evaporation from plant surfaces (canopy evaporation), and plant-regulated water transfer (transpiration). Since each component of ET responds differently to environmental conditions, separating total ET into these three components is essential for understanding its role in weather extremes.
    </p>

    <!-- Section: My Solution -->
    <h3>My Solution</h3>
    <p>
  I modified the CESM source code to implement water tracers for each component of ET. This required writing new FORTRAN code and developing a framework that allows other researchers to track these components independently in their own simulations.
    </p>

    <!-- Optional description -->
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The modified CESM source code with this new water-tracking functionality is publicly available here: <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15786353" target="_blank"> Repository Link</a>
